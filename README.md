# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Willow (aka **willowthecoder**)

I'm a **self-taught web developer** currently diving deep into **full-stack development**. Alongside web dev, I'm also exploring the exciting worlds of **Data Science**, **AI/ML**,**BlockChain** and **Cybersecurity**, which I aim to pursue more seriously in the near future. I am also trying to understand the **Computer Fundamentals and low level stuff**

As a **UI/UX enthusiast**, I value clean and accessible design. Iâ€™ve worked on **basic wireframing, prototyping, and visual design** using **Figma**, and Iâ€™m continually learning how to create better user experiences.
